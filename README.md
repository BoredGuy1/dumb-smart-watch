# dumb-smart-watch
Learning electrical engineering the hard way

## What is this?
This is a watch built from scratch using an Arduino. It's "smart" because it has a GPS, but it's also "dumb" because it doesn't report heartrate, steps, or anything else a smartwatch would normally report. It's just a GPS watch. It was originally a personal project to help me learn about microcontrollers, but I decided to upload the code and schematics in case anyone else wanted to do the same thing.
